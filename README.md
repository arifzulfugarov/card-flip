# Time X â€“ 3D Flip Cards

A simple 3D flip card UI built using HTML and SCSS to showcase the main features of the Time X smartwatch.

## Features
- 3D card flip on hover
- Clean and responsive design
- Easy to customize

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. If using SCSS, compile `style.scss` into `style.css` (already included)
3. Or paste `style.scss` into [CodePen](https://codepen.io) and set the CSS preprocessor to SCSS
4. You can deploy via GitHub Pages or any static hosting
5. I also included css as I rewrited scss into css. (so you can see in my work)
